# Movies-Recommendation-System

 This project is a movie recommender system built using the MovieLens dataset. It includes two main features: personalized user recommendations using advanced models like Neural Collaborative Filtering, and item-based similarity recommendations using cosine similarity. A user-friendly dashboard allows users to view their top-N recommended movies, explore item metadata, and find similar items. The system is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates the full pipeline‚Äîfrom data preprocessing and model training to interactive UI deployment.
